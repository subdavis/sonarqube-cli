# IMPORTANT: Read project files to learn about dev tooling.

- This is a `yarn` project.
- IMPORTANT: Read @README.md every time to start.
- IMPORTANT: Read @package.json every time to start.

# General instructions

- If I ask you to do anything related to the dev environment, like eslint or tsconfig, always check and read the relevent config files before deciding on what to do.
- Try not to write duplicate code, and reorganize if necessary to keep things DRY.
- After you've finished making edits and think they work, run eslint and typescript checks
